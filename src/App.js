    detail: [`I interned at Macy's for the summer of 2019. I was on their Machine Learning Platform Team and my project for the summer was a chatbot project.`,
    `I trained a customer service chatbot using RASA, an open source conversational AI framework, to handle inquiries regarding returns, shipment status, promotions, store locations, and product specifications.`,
    `I then implemented custom React components to show recommended Macyâ€™s products. Integrated with Macy's internal REST API to query for products relevant to the conversation.`,
    `Finally, I modified RASA to support multimodal inputs via both text and speech. Integrated with Google's voice-to-text API to transcribe voice input. I did this so that Google devices can use the chatbot.`,
    `Beside the chatbot, I also helped build a web application using React/Redux and Django to allow training chatbot through a web interface, without requiring operators to provision a local development environment.`]

    detail: [`I interned at J2 Global for the summer of 2018. This internship is where I learned most of my web development skills. I got to learn React JS, which is the front-end framework that I'm most passionate about.`,
    `I had 2 projects over that summer. First, I Built custom status tracking tool to monitor uptime and response times of over 50 websites. Implemented false positive detection and downtime alerts to notify marketing and engineering teams.`,
    `Then, I designed and led implementation of custom task monitoring tool to track status of JIRA tickets, and issue reports about stale tasks and development velocity. Delegated implementation between two other interns.`]

    detail: [`I took a different approach when creating my personal website. I want it to be interactive, and engaging, that's why I decided to make a Terminal emulator.`, `
    every functionality of this website is correctly implemented, most of the commands like 'ls', 'cd', 'open' are not hardcoded. the entire site is built with React JS (my favorite front-end framework) and hosted on Heroku.`,
